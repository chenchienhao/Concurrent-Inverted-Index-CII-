## Creation-Inverted-Index

**CII** is an experiment based on **programming language C** and concurrent programming **OpenMP API**, our target is implementing **non-blocking concept (Lock-Free)** and adding a search algorithm method for improving the performance of creating an inverted index.

In this moment we have applied **the binary search algorithm** on our works; Of course, we will show you the result of those experiments and logic of programming in our design of inverted index.
